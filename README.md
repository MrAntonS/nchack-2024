NCSU HACKATHON 2024 - BloodLink

Ideas:
Blood donation app

When you sign up you have the option to become either a donor or recipient or both.

On the donor end- you put your medical history; including blood type, weight, height, etc., as well as your location

On the recipient end- you input your blood type and location

The location should be private, until two people agree to meet

The recipients are then given a list of donors in their area that are avilable at the times that work for them, and when they select, the donor recieves a message which they can approve or deecline, and then a chat is oppened between them. They can work out a meeting between them at that point.

There is also a points system for donors- how many times they've given blood, how did the people like them, etc.
